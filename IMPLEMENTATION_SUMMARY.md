# Advanced Query APIs Implementation Summary

## Overview
I have successfully implemented a comprehensive set of APIs for querying tasks, sprints, projects, milestones, and time logs with advanced filtering capabilities, specifically time-based filtering as requested.

## üöÄ New Features Implemented

### 1. Advanced Query Endpoints (`/api/v1/queries/`)

#### Task Queries
- **GET** `/tasks/by-sprint/{sprint_id}` - Get all tasks for a specific sprint
- **GET** `/tasks/by-user/{user_id}` - Get all tasks assigned to a user

#### Sprint Queries  
- **GET** `/sprints/by-project/{project_id}` - Get all sprints for a project
- **GET** `/sprints/by-user/{user_id}` - Get sprints where user has tasks

#### Project Queries
- **GET** `/projects/by-user/{user_id}` - Get projects where user is involved (via team or tasks)

#### Time Log Queries
- **GET** `/time-logs/by-user/{user_id}` - Get time logs for a user
- **GET** `/time-logs/by-task/{task_id}` - Get time logs for a task  
- **GET** `/time-logs/by-sprint/{sprint_id}` - Get time logs for sprint tasks
- **GET** `/time-logs/by-project/{project_id}` - Get time logs for project tasks

#### Milestone Queries
- **GET** `/milestones/by-sprint/{sprint_id}` - Get milestones for a sprint
- **GET** `/milestones/by-project/{project_id}` - Get milestones for a project

#### Summary/Aggregation Endpoints
- **GET** `/summary/user/{user_id}/time-logs` - Get total hours for user
- **GET** `/summary/project/{project_id}/time-logs` - Get total hours for project
- **GET** `/summary/sprint/{sprint_id}/time-logs` - Get total hours for sprint

### 2. Enhanced Existing Endpoints

#### Time Logs Enhancement
- Enhanced `/api/v1/time-logs/` endpoint with time filtering support
- Added `start_date` and `end_date` query parameters

### 3. Universal Time Filtering

All endpoints support time filtering with:
- **`start_date`** - Filter from this date onwards
- **`end_date`** - Filter up to this date  
- **Date formats supported**: ISO 8601 (e.g., `2025-07-22T00:00:00Z`)

### 4. Comprehensive Access Control

- **Admin/Project Manager**: Full access to all data
- **Team Leader**: Access to their team's project data
- **Team Member**: Access to their team's project data  
- **Individual User**: Access only to their own data

### 5. Pagination Support

All list endpoints include:
- **`skip`** - Number of records to skip (default: 0)
- **`limit`** - Maximum records to return (default: 100)

## üìÅ Files Created/Modified

### New Files
1. **`app/api/v1/endpoints/advanced_queries.py`** - All new advanced query endpoints
2. **`app/schemas/milestone.py`** - Milestone schema definitions
3. **`ADVANCED_QUERIES_API_DOCUMENTATION.md`** - Comprehensive API documentation
4. **`API_USAGE_EXAMPLES.md`** - Real-world usage examples
5. **`test_advanced_queries.py`** - Test script for the new APIs

### Modified Files
1. **`app/api/v1/__init__.py`** - Added advanced queries router
2. **`app/api/v1/endpoints/time_logs.py`** - Enhanced with time filtering

## üéØ Key Features

### 1. Smart Time Filtering
- For most entities: filters by `created_at` field
- For time logs: filters by `date` field (when work was done)
- Supports both start and end date filtering

### 2. Intelligent Access Control
- Role-based access control
- Team-based project access
- Users can only access their own data (unless admin/PM)

### 3. Performance Optimized
- Pagination support for large datasets
- Efficient database queries
- Optional field loading

### 4. Flexible Querying
- Multiple filter combinations
- Date range filtering
- Resource-specific queries

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Database Queries
- Uses SQLAlchemy ORM for type safety
- Implements efficient JOIN operations
- Includes proper error handling

### Security
- JWT token authentication required
- Role-based authorization
- Team membership validation

### Response Formats
- Consistent JSON responses
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Comprehensive error messages

## üìä Example Usage Scenarios

### 1. Sprint Review Dashboard
```bash
# Get sprint tasks with time filter
GET /api/v1/queries/tasks/by-sprint/123?start_date=2025-07-01T00:00:00Z

# Get sprint time summary  
GET /api/v1/queries/summary/sprint/123/time-logs

# Get sprint milestones
GET /api/v1/queries/milestones/by-sprint/123
```

### 2. User Performance Analysis
```bash
# Get user's tasks in last month
GET /api/v1/queries/tasks/by-user/456?start_date=2025-06-22T00:00:00Z

# Get user's time logs
GET /api/v1/queries/time-logs/by-user/456?start_date=2025-06-22T00:00:00Z

# Get user's time summary
GET /api/v1/queries/summary/user/456/time-logs?start_date=2025-06-22T00:00:00Z
```

### 3. Project Cost Analysis
```bash
# Get project time logs for billing period
GET /api/v1/queries/time-logs/by-project/789?start_date=2025-07-01T00:00:00Z&end_date=2025-07-31T23:59:59Z

# Get project time summary
GET /api/v1/queries/summary/project/789/time-logs?start_date=2025-07-01T00:00:00Z&end_date=2025-07-31T23:59:59Z
```
