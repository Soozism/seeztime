## Usage Examples

### Get Project Summary Only
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/projects/1"
```

### Get Project with Detailed Lists
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/projects/1?include_details=true"
```

### Get Project without Expanded User Info
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/projects/1?expand=false"
```

## Key Features

### ðŸ“Š Comprehensive Statistics
- **Task Statistics**: Total tasks and breakdown by status (TODO, IN_PROGRESS, REVIEW, DONE)
- **Sprint Statistics**: Total sprints and breakdown by status (PLANNED, ACTIVE, COMPLETED)
- **Milestone Statistics**: Total milestones and breakdown by completion status

### ðŸ“ˆ Percentage Calculations
- All statistics include percentage breakdowns for easy visualization
- Percentages are calculated as (count / total) * 100 and rounded to 2 decimal places
- Zero division is handled gracefully (returns 0.0%)

### ðŸ“‹ Detailed Information (Optional)
When `include_details=true`:
- **Complete Task List**: All tasks with assignee info, sprint association, and detailed metadata
- **Complete Sprint List**: All sprints with task counts and status information
- **Complete Milestone List**: All milestones with completion status and sprint association

### ðŸ”’ Security & Access Control
- Requires authentication (JWT token)
- Respects existing project access permissions
- Role-based access control maintained

### âš¡ Performance Optimized
- Efficient database queries using aggregations
- Optional detailed loading (include_details parameter)
- Minimal N+1 query issues with proper joins

## Use Cases

### 1. Project Dashboard

## Performance Notes

1. **Basic Request**: Fast response with aggregated statistics only
2. **Detailed Request**: Slightly slower due to additional joins and data loading
3. **Caching Recommended**: Consider caching responses for frequently accessed projects
4. **Pagination**: Detailed lists are not paginated - consider limiting for very large projects
